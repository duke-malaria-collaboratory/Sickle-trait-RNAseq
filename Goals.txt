HbAS Time Series 

Experimental detail:
	- 48 hour time series on two P. falciparum strains
		-> 3D7
		-> FUP (Uganda Palo Alto)
	- 2 HbAA and 2 HbAS biological replicates/experiment
	- 3 hour sampling over 48 hours 
		-> 16 time points/experiment

Analytic goals

	- Determine which genes are temporally dysregulated in HbAS compared to HbAA
		-> Which genes are periodic in each group? (Strain x Hemoglobin) [DLxJTK]
		-> What nodes regulate gene expression? [LEM] 
			- Are the nodes and/or their targets differentially expressed between groups?
		-> 

Prioritization 

	- Ideal targets would be shared between both strains of P. falciparum and demonstrate a robust disruption in  HbAS
